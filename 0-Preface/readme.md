Aesthetic Programming: A Handbook of Software Studies

Preface

What kind of book is this? Reading its subtitle, it is clearly meant to be a handbook of sorts, but not in any conventional technical sense of it being a prescribed set of instructions (how-to recipe-style book) in order to find out how to do something like coding in a straightforward relation (for ‘dummies’, if you pardon the expression).[Note: explain apology perhaps] This handbook is not simply meant to be read in order to learn to code or indeed to offer critical reflection upon the practice of coding alone. Instead, it is something more messy and at the same time ambitious: a book to represent a more complex and deeply entangled set of relations between writing and coding as forms of usable knowledge production. 

The book is aimed at those who would like to learn how to read, write and *think* with program code. Most programming books are written with a primary objective of teaching readers how to learn a programming language to become a good (or better) programmer. There is a strong emphasis on state-of-the-art technology, as well as practical examples that are explained and then designed to be deployed in IT-related or creative industries. Not many programming books address the cultural and aesthetic dimensions of programming as a means to think critically and computationally, or to gain an expanded ‘coding literacy’.[Note: see Vee] 
// Explain this a bit more.
In emerging trans-disciplinary fields involving computational technology - such as software studies, platform studies, and digital humanities to an extent - the practice of programming is incorporated into the object of study and yet little practical advice is provided, especially to those studying non-science and engineering disciplines. 

This book attempts to address all these things, responding to this perceived gap in literature and the growing interest in ‘computational thinking’ to expand programming beyond the confines of computer science and engineering disciplines or even the digital huamnaities. Whilst operating broadly in the spirit of Software Studies, the book offers an overtly practice-oriented approach to understanding the centrality of reading, writing and thinking with software as a critical tool for our times, in recognition of the way in which our experiences are ever more programmed. It is offered as a deep learning tool - a handbook for those unaccustomed to programming - and one that allows for the critical agency of the programmer to develop as they become more proficient in both their technical and conceptual skills. 

Why Aesthetic Programming?

The phrase ‘Aesthetic Programming’ encapsulates our approach. This is closely related to ‘creative coding’ (Maeda, 2004; Peppler & Kafai, 2009) and ‘exploratory programming’ (Montfort 2016) that have been introduced in related literature in recent years to emphasize the expressivity of computer programming beyond something pragmatic and functional, in which cultural production, or critical thinking through practice, can be cultivated and developed through learning and understanding programming from the broad perspectives of the arts and humanities. By specifically invoking aesthetics, we point to a tradition ...

// add aesthetic theory and cultural studies ///////////
Thus we consider programming to be a cultural practice and phenomenon, as ways of thinking and doing in the world, to understand some of the complex procedures that underwrite our lived realities.

Aesthetic Programming is also the title we have given to one of the undergraduate courses in the Digital Design programme at Aarhus University, which has been taught in parallel to a course in Software Studies since 2013. Together the courses offer ways of thinking about software and computational culture to understand wider political, cultural, social and aesthetic phenomena. The structure of the book emerges from the experience of teaching these parallel courses. 

We draw upon Software Studies to deal with and communicate knowledge of software as a cultural form via analyses of examples of software artefacts and close readings of theoretical texts, developing a critical understanding of digital culture. We have been working with key concepts from programming as the starting point for analysis; not reading cultural phenomena in relation to programming concepts but rather an approach where the programming leads the discussion through a deep under-standing of the way it is constructed and is operationalized. The common ground therefore with both courses promotes the practical understanding and knowledge of programming to underpin critical understanding of techno-cultural systems.

In this spirit, it also draws upon concrete examples and makes an argument for the inherent interplay of aesthetics and technology. More specifically, there are increasing numbers of artists/programmers whose works explore computational culture and computer processing with a critical attitude (including the works of Winnie Soon, Daniel Howe, Shelly Knotts and many more). In such examples, ‘software art’ is often not considered as a practical tool that produces an artwork but as a critical-aesthetic object in itself. As media theorist Tilman Baumgärtel clarifies:

Software art is not art that has been created with the help of a computer but art that happens in the computer. Software is not programmed by artists, in order to produce autonomous work, but the software itself is the artwork. What is crucial here is not the result but the process triggered in the computer by the program code. (cited in Cox, 2007, p. 150)

In order to discuss the expressivity and aesthetic dimensions of code and computational processes, this book incorporates and presents artistic works that explore the materiality of software and computational processes alongside the practical and theoretical examination of programming. We take this approach broadly from cultural studies and aesthetic theory inasmuch as such works demonstrate an expanded critical capacity and potential for commentary on contemporary conditions. The term Aesthetic Programming thereby is useful as it points to computational processes and code as expressive materials to reflect the technical, cultural and political implications of tech-no-cultural systems.

In overall terms, readers will acquire key skills of programming in order to read, write and think with, and through, code. We see that it is important to fully explore the intersections of technical and cultural aspects of code in order to reflect deeply on the pervasiveness of computational culture and its effects, from the language and politics of human-machine languages to datafication and recent developments in automated machine intelligence. The book embraces both the technical aspect and formal qualities of code as well as critical discourses and thinking around code, particularly in terms of nonhuman agency and feminist new materialism. Thus it proposes a material-discursive practice with which to acknowledge the conditions of programming practice, including the agency of code itself.

We consider our approach to be distinctive from other programming books on the market that are more focused on programming languages from an engineering perspective, as well as distinctive from other theoretical books where source code becomes an illustration of thinking or too-easy analogy (if not ignored altogether). We aim to bridge the gap between theories of computational culture, aesthetic theory and cultural studies and the practice of programming and thereby provide epistemic insights. As part of this, we take a particular interest in power relations rarely acknowledged, such as class, gender, race, and authoritarianism, built into technological systems. In short, the handbook introduces and demonstrates a distinctive approach through the combined and reflexive practice of aesthetic programming and offers a means to learn programming critically.



/////// More specifically, the programming language JavaScript is introduced alongside core programming concepts as material for thinking with, and for thinking through complex ideas and dynamic concepts.

////// The proposed book, Aesthetic Programming, unlike those traditional books with only text materials, but also include software and program code that would be stored in an open-access repository. The program code can be run online via a web browser. The overall publishing process, including writing, editing, coding, printing would require supporting both text, graphics, multimedia and software performance. Additionally, it is important to keep the versioning and open access of the text and program code changes for the whole writing process to increase accessibility and transparency. To support this kind of non-traditional and emerging publishing plat-form, a collective called Open Source Publishing, a Brussel-based organization as part of CONSTANT, will run workshop, design and support this special form.

More to the point, text is in code (in the ways that it is made human-readable) and code is in text (in the use of the text editor, interfaces and online platforms we use to render these thoughts). There is more to say on this, and we will return to these issues across the various chapters of the book. Suffice to say for now that the ways that writing and coding are entangled is what this book is about, and neither are to be privileged over the other: we learn from their relationality. 

Writing code and writing about code are forced together in ways that reflect broader cultural and technical shifts in data practices and open publishing initiatives, and moreover to emphasise that writing a book is necessarily a work in progress. In other words, this is a book to be read and acted upon, rewritten and recoded. Our use of a git repository for our writing further emphasises this point, and how by treating writing as software, or indeed software as writing, it allows us to formalise the production of the book as an iterative process, in need of timely updates and rethinking. In allowing for new versions to be produced by others, we hope in a modest way to challenge commercial publishing conventions and illuminate our capacity to understand some of the infrastructures through which we encode our ideas and distribute them over networks. As such the book is not simply a physical object that you might be holding in your hands as you read these words, but a computational and networked object too, distributed across various other spaces and temporalities, and made available to readers and writers. 

There are clearly many precedents for this approach in software production, and evidently free and open source principles underscore our approach. It is worth emphasising that FOSS development is a collective practice that challenges the normative relations of production associated with commercial development which can be extended to the production of books and the associated reputation economy of academic publishing. Having said that we also recognise that the release of source code and open access books represents a number of ambiguities related to the sharing economy, free market capitalism and opportunities to capitalise on free labour. However we persist in the hope that our efforts challenge market logic, and as such are inspired by the feminist and copyleft principles of groups like Constant in Brussels, and the associated open source publishing initiative (OSP) who we have collaborated with on the design this book. 
We acknowledge numerous experimental publishing initiatives and even anti-platforms such as dokieli for decentralised article publishing.[Note: dokieli is a clientside editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions, see https://dokie.li/] Our publisher, Open Humanities Press, is more pragmatic but reflects these broad principles of transparency and reproducibility in its commitment to radical open access for scholarly work. [note: add links to OSP and OHP] As such this book can be downloaded for free or purchased as a hard copy at a very reasonable price. All this is important such that the design of the book is treated both as an aesthetic and computational object, and moreover as a political problem.

00.3 Culture of Github/Gitlab

// include discussion of Git, acronym or not

The book aims to expose something of what Adrian Mackenzie has identified as “auto-archaeology” to indicate how the object of study is fully integrated into the analysis.[see Adrian Mackenzie’s preface to Machine Learners: Archaeology of a Data Practice, MIT Press 2017] An insight into the background thinking of his *Machine Learners* can be found on the associated GitLab site at https://github.com/datapractice/machinelearners.
