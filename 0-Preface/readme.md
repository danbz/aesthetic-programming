Preface

What kind of book is this? Reading its subtitle, it is clearly meant to be a handbook of sorts, but not in any conventional technical sense of it being a prescribed set of instructions (how-to recipe-book) in order to find out how to do something like coding in a straightforward relation (for ‘dummies’, if you pardon the expression). This handbook is not simply meant to be read in order to learn to code or indeed to offer critical reflection upon the practice of coding alone. Instead, it is something more messy and ambitious:  a book to represent a more complex and deeply entangled set of relations between writing and coding as forms of knowledge production. More to the point, text is in code (in the ways that it is made human-readable) and code is in text (in the use of the text editor, interfaces and online platforms we use to render these thoughts). There is more to say on this, and we will return to these issues across the various chapters of the book. Suffice to say for now that the ways that writing and coding are entangled is what this book is about, and neither are to be privileged over the other: we learn from their relationality. 

Writing code and writing about code are forced together in ways that reflect broader cultural and technical shifts in data practices and open publishing initiatives, and moreover to emphasise that writing a book is necessarily a work in progress. In other words, this is a book to be read and acted upon, rewritten and recoded. Our use of a git repository for our writing further emphasises this point, and how by treating writing as software, or indeed software as writing, it allows us to formalise the production of the book as an iterative process, in need of timely updates and rethinking. In allowing for new versions to be produced by others, we hope in a modest way to challenge commercial publishing conventions and illuminate our capacity to understand some of the infrastructures through which we encode our ideas and distribute them over networks. As such the book is not simply a physical object that you might be holding in your hands as you read these words, but a computational and networked object too, distributed across various other spaces and temporalities, and made available to readers and writers. 

There are clearly many precedents for this approach in software production, and evidently free and open source principles underscore our approach. It is worth emphasising that free and open source software development is a collective practice that challenges the normative relations of production associated with commercial development which can be extended to the production of books and the associated reputation economy of academic publishing. Having said that we also recognise that the release of source code and open access books represents a number of ambiguities related to the sharing economy, free market capitalism and opportunities to capitalise on free labour. However we persist in the hope that our efforts challenge market logic, and as such are inspired by the feminist and copyleft principles of groups like Constant in Brussels, and the associated open source publishing initiative (OSP) who we have collaborated with on the design this book. This is important as the design of the book is treated both as an aesthetic and computational problem. Moreover our publisher, Open Humanities Press, reflects these principles in its commitment to radical open access for scholarly work. [note: add links to OSP and OHP] The book can be donloaded for free or purchased as a hard copy at a reasonable price.

00.1 Coding Literacy
Uses of Literacy - Richard Hoggart
this informs the development of Cultural Studies initially around the inclusion of working class cultures and an expanded notion of literacy... Also Raymond Williams’ Cultural Materialism - all from a literary tradition. 

Also Coding Literacy by Annette Vee

Raymond Williams Keywords 
This Lexicon as inspiration - eg. Culture as one of the most contested terms - its multiple meanings, including anthropological sense. 
- addition of race to discussion, as well as gender and sexuality of course. Disruption of base and superstructure model of classical Marxism.
eg. Stuart Hall “Encoding, Decoding” (semiotic tradition, linguistics as way of reading culture)

lack of attention to alt.right and sub-culture (ref. Florian Cramer and Angela Nagle at transmediale)

00.2 Cultures of Coding

Inspired by Software Studies: A Lexicon.

Our key terms might be: culture, aesthetics, programming...

coding in tradition of literary criticism (critical code studies)
Free and open source principles.

changing literacy - Walter Ong’s Orality and Literacy... (maybe even Neil Postman)
check out Kevin Brock : Treating code as a pervasive argument

00.3 Culture of Github/Gitlab

The book aims to expose something of what Adrian Mackenzie has identified as “auto-archaeology” to indicate how the object of study is fully integrated into the analysis.[see Adrian Mackenzie’s preface to Machine Learners: Archaeology of a Data Practice, MIT Press 2017] An insight into the background thinking of his *Machine Learners* can be found on the associated GitLab site at https://github.com/datapractice/machinelearners.

So what is coding literacy, and why is it important?
