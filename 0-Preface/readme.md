What kind of book is this? Reading its subtitle it is clearly meant to be a handbook of sorts, but not in any conventional technical sense of it being a prescribed set of instructions (how-to recipe-book) in order to find out how to do something like coding in a straightforward relation (for ‘dummies’, if you pardon the expression). This handbook is not simply meant to be read in order to learn to code or indeed to offer critical reflection upon the practice of coding alone. Instead, it is meant to represent a more complex and deeply entangled set of relations between writing and coding as forms of knowledge production and aesthetic practice. Writing code and writing about code are forced together in ways that reflect broader cultural and technical shifts in the analysis of data and open publishing initiatives. Our use of a git repository for our writing further emphasises the point of how these practices come together in productive ways to illuminate our capacity to understand the infrastructures through which we encode our ideas and distribute them freely over networks. 

There are clearly many precedents for this in software production, and free and open source principles underscore our iterative working process but we have tried to extend this to all aspects of our approach which include production and distribution. We are inspired by the work of groups like Constant in Brussels and the associated open source publishing initiative (OSP) who we have collaborated with on the design this book as well as Open Humanities Press through which we publish this volume (add links to OSP and OHP). But of course this approach runs wider than that, to scientific and engineering publication conventions more broadly, and open access principles of peer review, diversity and transparency, and more conceptually to what Adrian Mackenzie has identified as “auto-archaeology” to indicate how the object of study is fully integrated into the analysis (see Adrian Mackenzie’s preface to Machine Learners: Archaeology of a Data Practice, MIT Press 2017; also see https://github.com/datapractice/machinelearners). Indeed text is in code (in the ways that it is made human-readable) and code is in text (in the use of the text editor, interfaces and online platforms we use to render these thoughts. There is more to say on this, and we will return to these issues in the various chapters of the book. Suffice to say for now that the ways that writing and coding are entangled is what this book is about, and neither are to be privileged above the other: we learn from their relationality.  

- how is it different from introduction to programming

// The perversity of writing a book about coding does not go unnoticed either, especially when chunks of code are displayed on the page...

NOTES 00 Coding Literacy
00.1
Uses of Literacy - Richard Hoggart
this informs the development of Cultural Studies initially around the inclusion of working class cultures and an expanded notion of literacy... Also Raymond Williams’ Cultural Materialism - all from a literary tradition. 

Also Coding Literacy by Annette Vee

Raymond Williams Keywords 
This Lexicon as inspiration - eg. Culture as one of the most contested terms - its multiple meanings, including anthropological sense. 
- addition of race to discussion, as well as gender and sexuality of course. Disruption of base and superstructure model of classical Marxism.
eg. Stuart Hall “Encoding, Decoding” (semiotic tradition, linguistics as way of reading culture)

lack of attention to alt.right and sub-culture (ref. Florian Cramer and Angela Nagle at transmediale)

00.2 Cultures of Coding

Inspired by Software Studies: A Lexicon.

Our key terms might be: culture, aesthetics, programming...

coding in tradition of literary criticism (critical code studies)
Free and open source principles.

changing literacy - Walter Ong’s Orality and Literacy... (maybe even Neil Postman)

00.3 Culture of Github/Gitlab
Matthew Fuller, Andrew Goffey, Adrian Mackenzie, Richard Mills and Stuart Sharples, "Big Diff, Granularity, Incoherence, and Production in the Github Software Repository" in How To Be a Geek: Essays on the Culture of Software.

So what is coding literacy, and why is it important?
