Aesthetic Programming: A Handbook of Software Studies

Preface

What kind of book is this? Reading its subtitle, it is clearly meant to be a handbook of sorts, but not in any conventional technical sense of it being a prescribed set of instructions (how-to recipe-style book) in order to find out how to do something like coding in a straightforward relation (for ‘dummies’, if you pardon the expression).[Note: explain how dummy doesn't follow political correctness] This handbook is not simply meant to be read in order to learn to code or indeed to offer critical reflection upon the practice of coding alone. Instead, it is something more messy and at the same time ambitious: a book to represent a more complex and deeply entangled set of relations between writing and coding as applied and usable knowledge.

The book is aimed at those who would like to learn how to read, write and *think* with program code. Most programming books are written with a primary objective of teaching readers how to learn a programming language to become a good (or better) programmer, with an emphasis on state-of-the-art technology, as well as practical examples that are explained and then designed to be deployed in IT-related or creative industries. Not many programming books address the cultural and aesthetic dimensions of programming as a means to think critically and computationally. 

In emerging trans-disciplinary fields involving computational technology -- such as software studies, platform studies, and digital humanities to an extent -- the practice of programming is incorporated into the object of study and yet little practical detail is provided, especially to those studying non-technical or scientific disciplines. This book attempts to address this perceived gap in literature and the growing interest in ‘computational thinking’ to expand programming beyond the confines of computer science and engineering or even the digital humnaities which prresents a set of other limitations. We consider our approach to be distinctive from other programming books that are more focused on programming languages from an engineering perspective, as well as distinctive from other theoretical books where source code becomes an illustration of thinking or too-easy analogy (if not ignored altogether). 

Whilst operating broadly in the spirit of Software Studies,[add note] the book offers an applied and overtly practice-based approach to understanding the centrality of programming -- the reading, writing and thinking with software -- as a critical tool for our times, in recognition of the way in which our experiences are ever more programmed. It is offered as a deep learning tool -- a handbook for those unaccustomed to programming -- and one that allows for the critical agency of the programmer to develop as they become more proficient in both their technical and conceptual skills. If tools are invoked then only in the widest sense. 

Our intention is that readers will acquire key skills of programming in order to read, write and think with, and through, code. We see that it is important to fully explore the intersections of technical and cultural aspects of code in order to reflect deeply on the pervasiveness of computational culture and its effects, from the language and politics of human-machine languages to datafication and recent developments in automated machine intelligence. The book embraces both the technical aspect and formal qualities of code as well as critical discourses and thinking around code, particularly in terms of nonhuman agency and feminist new materialism. Thus it proposes a material-discursive practice with which to acknowledge the conditions of programming practice, including the agency of code itself.

We aim to bridge the gap between theories of computational culture, aesthetic theory and cultural studies, and the practice of programming and thereby to provide new (epistemic) insights. As part of this, we take a particular interest in power relations rarely acknowledged, such as class, gender, race, and the authoritarian logic of command and control built into computational systems. In short, the handbook introduces and demonstrates a distinctive approach through the intersectional and reflexive practice of aesthetic programming as we understand it.

So why aesthetic programming? The position the book presents is that computational culture is not just a trendy subject to study or a way to understand what is happening with computational processes, but something to engage in as an active way to create change. Thus we consider programming to be a cultural practice and phenomenon, as thinking and doing in the world, to understand some of the complex procedures that underwrite our lived realities, and to act upon that reality.  

We consider that the phrase ‘Aesthetic Programming’ best describes our approach. We claim our distinctiveness here, but of course this is closely related to other phrases such as ‘creative coding’ and ‘exploratory programming’ that have been introduced in related literature in recent years to emphasize the expressivity of computer programming beyond something pragmatic and functional, in which cultural production, or critical thinking through practice, can be cultivated and developed through learning and understanding programming from the broad perspectives of the arts and humanities.[Note: Here we are referring to Maeda, 2004; Peppler & Kafai, 2009; Montfort 2016, add more?] It should be explained that the title 'aesthetic programming' derives from one of the undergraduate courses in the Digital Design programme at Aarhus University, which has been taught in parallel to a course in Software Studies since 2013. Together the courses offer ways of thinking about software and computational culture to understand wider political, cultural, social and aesthetic phenomena. We follow the principle that the growing importance of software requires a new kind of cultural thinking that can account for, and with which to understand, the politics and aesthetics of algorithms, loops, variables, and other key concepts. The structure of the book largely emerges from the experience of teaching these parallel courses, and we thank all our students and fellow teachers for their contributions and critique. 

To go deeper, by specifically invoking aesthetics, of course we do not refer to beauty as it is often misunderstood, but point to the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, and in particular Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, to enforce the idea that cultural production -- which would include programming for us -- must be seen in a social context and has a political function. Programming becomes a kind of force-field to understand material conditions and social contradictions, just as the interpretation of art once operated "as a kind of code language for processes taking place within society". [Note: continuing the quote: "... which must be deciphered by means of critical analysis." (Martin Jay, Aesthetic Theory, 1996: 177).] Technology plays its part here, and the infamous artwork essay by Benjamin becomes a touchstone for dismantling some of the associated myths of artistic production including the dismantling of authenticity and hence the aesthetic experience of its "aura" (teh mark of its authenticity and originality). [Note: To quote Benjamin on this point: "The instant the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed. Instead of being based on ritual, it begins to be based on another practice - politics." (ref?)] It is worth remembering that Adorno and Benjamin famously disagreed on the consequences of this destruction of aura: whilst Benjamin expressed the positive aspects of this shift and the destruction of aura is a kind of political emancipation, Adorno expressed the negative view that standardisation and pseudo-individuality would ensue. We can clearly see these tendencies accelerated with computational culture and the continuing need for sharp critique, but one also based on "immanent criticism" -- that which is inherent, as it operates within its object -- in the inner workings of software and its material conditions. 

And software studies... 

We draw upon the field of Software Studies to deal with and communicate knowledge of software as a cultural form via analyses of examples of software artefacts and close readings of theoretical texts, developing a critical understanding of computational culture. We have been working with key concepts from programming as the starting point for our analysis (such as class, function, loop); not reading cultural phenomena in relation to programming concepts but rather an approach where the programming leads the discussion through a deep understanding of the way it is constructed and operationalized. The common ground therefore with both courses promotes the practical understanding and knowledge of programming to underpin critical understanding of techno-cultural systems. We take our cue from Matthew Fuller's *Software Studies: A Lexicon* from 2008, structured literally as a lexicon of key terms, in turn taking its cue from Raymond Williams' *Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society* published in 1976.[Note: add REFS]

In many ways, and put simply, our book can be thought of as an update of both with far more attention to the detail of software from the inside, but also like any lexicon, as a way to attest to the ways in which words exert power through meanings and also through their actions as commands and instructions. In this respect it is also important to recognise that the book Software Studies comes from a workshop, and it is worth quoting the project page for its clarity of intention: 

"[T]he project aims at folding the internalist/externalist question of science studies inside out, the mechanisms of the one conjugating the subject of the other: what does software-enabled scholarship, in software, art and literary practice have to say about its own medium? The purpose of this interaction is not therefore to stage some revelation of a supposed hidden truth of software, to unmask its esoteric reality, but to see what it is and what it can be coupled with: a rich seam of paradoxical conjunctions in which the speed and rationality of computation meets with its ostensible outside." [Note: https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop]




// We believe that these key concepts from programming offer the possibility to open up new insights into aesthetics and design processes, and offer new perspectives on cultural phenomena increasingly subject to computational procedures and logic. 


In taking our distance from engineering traditions, we also emphasise the usefulness of art to open up other kinds of questions...
In this spirit, it also draws upon concrete examples and makes an argument for the inherent interplay of aesthetics and technology. More specifically, there are increasing numbers of artists/programmers whose works explore computational culture and computer processing with a critical attitude (including the works of Winnie Soon, Daniel Howe, Shelly Knotts and many more). In such examples, ‘software art’ is often not considered as a practical tool that produces an artwork but as a critical-aesthetic object in itself. As media theorist Tilman Baumgärtel clarifies:

Software art is not art that has been created with the help of a computer but art that happens in the computer. Software is not programmed by artists, in order to produce autonomous work, but the software itself is the artwork. What is crucial here is not the result but the process triggered in the computer by the program code. (cited in Cox, 2007, p. 150)

In order to discuss the expressivity and aesthetic dimensions of code and computational processes, this book incorporates and presents artistic works that explore the materiality of software and computational processes alongside the practical and theoretical examination of programming. We take this approach broadly from cultural studies and aesthetic theory inasmuch as such works demonstrate an expanded critical capacity and potential for commentary on contemporary conditions. The term Aesthetic Programming thereby is useful as it points to computational processes and code as expressive materials to reflect the technical, cultural and political implications of tech-no-cultural systems.




Form/book

/////// More specifically, the programming language JavaScript is introduced alongside core programming concepts as material for thinking with, and for thinking through complex ideas and dynamic concepts.

////// The proposed book, Aesthetic Programming, unlike those traditional books with only text materials, but also include software and program code that would be stored in an open-access repository. The program code can be run online via a web browser. The overall publishing process, including writing, editing, coding, printing would require supporting both text, graphics, multimedia and software performance. Additionally, it is important to keep the versioning and open access of the text and program code changes for the whole writing process to increase accessibility and transparency. To support this kind of non-traditional and emerging publishing plat-form, a collective called Open Source Publishing, a Brussel-based organization as part of CONSTANT, will run workshop, design and support this special form.

More to the point, text is in code (in the ways that it is made human-readable) and code is in text (in the use of the text editor, interfaces and online platforms we use to render these thoughts). There is more to say on this, and we will return to these issues across the various chapters of the book. Suffice to say for now that the ways that writing and coding are entangled is what this book is about, and neither are to be privileged over the other: we learn from their relationality. 

Writing code and writing about code are forced together in ways that reflect broader cultural and technical shifts in data practices and open publishing initiatives, and moreover to emphasise that writing a book is necessarily a work in progress. In other words, this is a book to be read and acted upon, rewritten and recoded. Our use of a git repository for our writing further emphasises this point, and how by treating writing as software, or indeed software as writing, it allows us to formalise the production of the book as an iterative process, in need of timely updates and rethinking. In allowing for new versions to be produced by others, we hope in a modest way to challenge commercial publishing conventions and illuminate our capacity to understand some of the infrastructures through which we encode our ideas and distribute them over networks. As such the book is not simply a physical object that you might be holding in your hands as you read these words, but a computational and networked object too, distributed across various other spaces and temporalities, and made available to readers and writers. 

There are clearly many precedents for this approach in software production, and evidently free and open source principles underscore our approach. It is worth emphasising that FOSS development is a collective practice that challenges the normative relations of production associated with commercial development which can be extended to the production of books and the associated reputation economy of academic publishing. Having said that we also recognise that the release of source code and open access books represents a number of ambiguities related to the sharing economy, free market capitalism and opportunities to capitalise on free labour. However we persist in the hope that our efforts challenge market logic, and as such are inspired by the feminist and copyleft principles of groups like Constant in Brussels, and the associated open source publishing initiative (OSP) who we have collaborated with on the design this book. 
We acknowledge numerous experimental publishing initiatives and even anti-platforms such as dokieli for decentralised article publishing.[Note: dokieli is a clientside editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions, see https://dokie.li/] Our publisher, Open Humanities Press, is more pragmatic but reflects these broad principles of transparency and reproducibility in its commitment to radical open access for scholarly work. [note: add links to OSP and OHP] As such this book can be downloaded for free or purchased as a hard copy at a very reasonable price. All this is important such that the design of the book is treated both as an aesthetic and computational object, and moreover as a political problem.
