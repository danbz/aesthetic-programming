## 1. Getting Started

## 1.1 Begin()
Why do we need to learn programming?
README and RUNME

### 1.1.1 Start()
What is, and why, p5.js? 
Web p5.js
syntax reading 

## 1.2 Working Environment
p5.js + Atom + Gitlab

### 1.2.1 p5.js 
reading code and syntax 

### 1.2.2 Code editor 
ATOM 

### 1.2.3 Git and Repository
Gitlab

## 1.3 not Hello World
Running the program with a web browser 

## 1.X While()

## 1.x.1 Excercise in class 
?

## 1.x.2 Mini_Exervise[1]: Think About My First Program
**Objective:**
- To learn the basic setup, including writing code with a code editor, running code with a web browser, independent study of code syntax, uploading files on gitlab, creating a readme file, etc.
- To reflect upon the process of coding

**Task (RUNME):**
1. Make sure you have read/watch the required readings/instructional videos and references
2. Study at least one syntax from the list of p5.js' [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) (of course, it is always good to know more different syntax. Be curious!)
3. Familiar yourself with the reference structure: example, description, syntax and parameters (This becomes your essential and life-long skills for learning new syntax on your own)
4. Use, Read, Modify (or even combine) the sample code that you found (the most basic level is changing the numbers), and produce a new sketch as a 'runme'

**Questions to think about as README:**
- Describe your first independent coding process (in relation to thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing, uploading, sharing, commenting code)
- How your coding process is differ from, or similar to, reading and writing text? 
- What is code and coding/programming practice means to you?
