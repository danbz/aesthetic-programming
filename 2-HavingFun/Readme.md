## 2. Having fun with Geometry

## 2.1 function setup()
Building upon the previous first sample code on the shape - ellipse, we want to further explore various shapes, size, positions, space, lengths, areas which are regarded as geometry in Mathematics disclipline. It has many applications, including architecture and art, in which points, lines, panes are regarded as the foundational elements of Design. They are the elements that constitute objects, and the world is made up of various objects in different shapes, size and spaces. Geometry is used to position as a fun subject (ref: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Geometry-Fun-Vicky-Owyang-Chan/dp/145755884X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=9781457558849&linkCode=qs&qid=1569494462&s=books&sr=1-1) especially in education sector. It is familiar but challenging to create new patterns and forms of representation. 

But fun in computing, as Olga Goriunova argues, "as a mode of thinking, making, experencing is about a mode of reasoning" (ref: xxx). In other words, fun is about paradox and sense making too; and in the area of geometry, it is about both bodily and material affections. We want to situate this chapter within the cultural context of geometric emojis. The affective expressions and facial representations that we use in almost all sort of electronic communications. It is fun as it is related to subjectivity and abstraction, producing a subjecthood and abstracting certain facial characteristics, which are not an actual representation of one's face but an imaginary and constructed one.

intro:
Learning to do something hard in programming, is this fun? (Olga's book)
how to learn? (a hint to ch.10), cognitive development esp. in children (smilies)
political correctness - what is fun to some and not others?

## 2.1.1 Start()
- Coordination
- Variables
- Geometries: shapes/pattern
- Drawing faces 
e.g 
0. some examples of children drawing
1. Tofu face by Fracis
2. Data browser series book 

## 2.2 

## 2.X While()
outro:
- emoticons 
- link to Femke + constant works on emoticons (race)
- faciality machines (Deleuze)
- facial recognition

## 2.X Exercise in class 

## 2.X Mini_Exercise[2]: Geometric emoji
**Objective:**
- To experiment various geometric drawing's possibilites, especially on shapes and drawing with colors.
- To reflect critically on emoji via the provided text on "Modifying the Universal"

**To get some additional inspiration here:**
- [Multi](http://o-r-g.com/apps/multi) by David Reinfurt
- [Machine Feeling- call for participation](http://www.aprja.net/machine-feeling-call/)
- [Chinese Characters as Ancient Emoji](https://publish.illinois.edu/iaslibrary/2015/10/21/chinese-characters/)

**Tasks (RUNME):**
1. Make sure you have read/watch the required readings/instructional videos and references
2. Explore different shape and geometric related syntax (via p5.js [references](https://p5js.org/reference/))
3. Design two emoji icons and reflect upon how does emoji relate to identity and cultural phenomena

**Questions to think about as README:**
  - **Describe** your program and what you have used and learnt
  - **What** have you learnt from reading the assigned reading? **How** would you put your emoji into a wider cultural context that concerns identification, identity, race, social, economics, culture, device politics and beyond? (Try to think through the assigned reading and your coding process, and then expand that to your experience and thoughts - this is a difficult task, you may need to spend sometimes in thinking about it)
