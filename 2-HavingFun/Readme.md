## 2. Having fun with Geometry

## 2.1 function setup()
Building upon the previous first sample code on the shape - ellipse, we want to further explore various shapes, size, positions, space, lengths, areas which are regarded as geometry in Mathematics disclipline. It has many applications, including architecture and art, in which points, lines, panes are regarded as the foundational elements of Design. They are the elements that constitute objects, and the world is made up of various objects in different shapes, size and spaces. Geometry is used to position as a fun subject (ref: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Geometry-Fun-Vicky-Owyang-Chan/dp/145755884X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=9781457558849&linkCode=qs&qid=1569494462&s=books&sr=1-1) especially in education sector. It is familiar but challenging to create new patterns and forms of representation. 

But fun in computing, as Olga Goriunova argues, "as a mode of thinking, making, experencing is about a mode of reasoning" (ref: xxx). In other words, fun is about paradox and sense making too; and in the area of geometry, it is about both bodily and material affections. We want to situate this chapter within the cultural context of geometric emojis. The affective expressions and facial representations that we use in almost all sort of electronic communications. It is fun as it is related to subjectivity and abstraction, producing a subjecthood and abstracting certain facial characteristics, which are not an actual representation of one's face but an imaginary and constructed one. 

But with the design and development of emoji, it has become a pre-coded form of representation and identification. The relationship between emoji and identitiy politics has been explored in the text 'Modifying the Universal', written by Rosel Roscam Abbing, Peggy Pierrot and Femke Snelting (ref: x). They investigate the process of universal standardisation of emoji, in which The Unicode Consortium, a non-profit organization based in America and is concerned with universal character encoding standards, is the key entity to standardize, maintain and publish the Unicode Standard for software internationalization in all major operating systems and applications since 1987. But the development of emoji encounters different issues over time, including the sterotypes of gender and racism, such as female emoji only existed in feminine roles like dancer, bride, and queen but not in professions like doctors and businessmen; as well as limited skin tones applied on emojis and such "universal modifiers" as a feature where there is technological limitation to use across all handsets. Typing emojis may be fun and expressive, but this also expresses normative ideologies within the violent structures, where some people can be represented but not others. So the question is who can get to be represented and why? As Goriunova explores the notion of fun in her edited book *Fun and Software*, she reminds us such bodily and material affections within computational structure that are paradoxically produced as fun objects "across the political, experiential registers, and in the computational feeding on the computational",  which is distributed across society and culture. (p.4)

Such cultural biases is what we want to think about in this chapter by introducing geometry which is situated within the context of emojis.

Learning to do something hard in programming, is this fun? (Olga's book)
how to learn? (a hint to ch.10), cognitive development esp. in children (smilies)
political correctness - what is fun to some and not others?

## 2.X Exercise in class 

## 2.X Mini_Exercise[2]: Geometric emoji
**Objective:**
- To experiment various geometric drawing's possibilites, especially on shapes and drawing with colors.
- To reflect critically on emoji via the provided text on "Modifying the Universal"

**To get some additional inspiration here:**

**Tasks (RUNME):**
1. Make sure you have read/watch the required readings/instructional videos and references
2. Explore different shape and geometric related syntax (via p5.js [references](https://p5js.org/reference/))
3. Design two emoji icons and reflect upon how does emoji relate to identity and cultural phenomena

**Questions to think about as README:**
  - **Describe** your program and what you have used and learnt
  - **What** have you learnt from reading the assigned reading? **How** would you put your emoji into a wider cultural context that concerns identification, identity, race, social, economics, culture, device politics and beyond? (Try to think through the assigned reading and your coding process, and then expand that to your experience and thoughts - this is a difficult task, you may need to spend sometimes in thinking about it)
