Having fun with Geometry/Maths

intro:
Learning to do something hard in programming, is this fun? (Olga's book)
how to learn? (a hint to ch.10), cognitive development esp. in children (smilies)
political correctness - what is fun to some and not others?

## 2.1.1 Start()
- Coordination
- Variables
- Geometries: shapes/pattern
- Drawing faces 
e.g 
0. some examples of children drawing
1. Tofu face by Fracis
2. Data browser series book 

## 2.2 

## 2.X While()
outro:
- emoticons 
- link to Femke + constant works on emoticons (race)
- faciality machines (Deleuze)
- facial recognition

## 2.X Exercise in class 

## 2.X Mini_Exercise[2]: Geometric emoji
**Objective:**
- To experiment various geometric drawing's possibilites, especially on shapes and drawing with colors.
- To reflect critically on emoji via the provided text on "Modifying the Universal"

**To get some additional inspiration here:**
- [Multi](http://o-r-g.com/apps/multi) by David Reinfurt
- [Machine Feeling- call for participation](http://www.aprja.net/machine-feeling-call/)
- [Chinese Characters as Ancient Emoji](https://publish.illinois.edu/iaslibrary/2015/10/21/chinese-characters/)
- [Women finally get a menstruation emoji](https://www.fastcompany.com/90302946/women-finally-get-a-menstruation-emoji?fbclid=IwAR2dGUBP3DiYNRYX_4NUghCAo4E9zH6HaJC1OK3PfOynbusdf15hP171OgE)


**Tasks (RUNME):**
1. Make sure you have read/watch the required readings/instructional videos and references
2. Explore different shape and geometric related syntax (via p5.js [references](https://p5js.org/reference/))
3. Design two emoji icons and reflect upon how does emoji relate to identity and cultural phenomena

**Questions to think about as README:**
  - **Describe** your program and what you have used and learnt
  - **What** have you learnt from reading the assigned reading? **How** would you put your emoji into a wider cultural context that concerns identification, identity, race, social, economics, culture, device politics and beyond? (Try to think through the assigned reading and your coding process, and then expand that to your experience and thoughts - this is a difficult task, you may need to spend sometimes in thinking about it)

## Required readings:
- Abbing, R.R, Pierrot, P and Snelting, F., "[Modifying the Universal.](http://www.data-browser.net/db06.html)"Executing Practices. Eds. Helen Pritchard, Eric Snodgrass & Magda Ty≈ºlik-Carver. Open Humanities Press, 2018, pp. 35-51
- OR [Modifying the Universal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP2bQ_4Q7DY) (1 hr 15 mins video) by Femke Snelting
- p5.js [Simple Shapes](https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-simple-shapes.html)
- [Short p5.js video by Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)(watch 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2)
