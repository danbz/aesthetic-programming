### Aesthetic Programming: A Handbook of Software Studies

by Winnie Soon and Geoff Cox

The book explores the technical and formal qualities as well as cultural imaginaries of programming from its insides. It follows the principle that the growing importance of software requires a new kind of cultural thinking — and curriculum — that can account for, and with which to understand better the politics and aesthetics of algorithmic procedures, data processing and abstraction. It takes a particular interest in power relations that are relatively under-acknowledged in technical subjects, concerning class, gender and sexuality, as well as race. This not only related to the politics of representation but also nonrepresentation: how power differentials are implicit in code in terms of binary logic, hierarchies, naming of the attributes, and how particular worldviews are further reinforced and perpetuated through computation. It introduces and demonstrates the intersectional and reflexive practice of *aesthetic programming*, engaging with learning to program as a way to better understand and question existing technological objects and to explore the potential for reprogramming wider socio-technical systems.
