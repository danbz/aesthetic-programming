### Aesthetic Programming: A Handbook of Software Studies

by Winnie Soon and Geoff Cox

The book embraces both the technical aspect and formal qualities of code as well as imaginaries of code. We follow the principle that the growing importance of software requires a new kind of cultural thinking — and curriculum — that can account for, and with which to understand better — from the inside — the politics and aesthetics of algorithmic procedures, data processing and abstracted modeling. This book explores the intersections of technical and cultural aspects of code in order to reflect deeply on the pervasiveness of computational culture and its social and cultural effects. We take a particular interest in power relations that are under-acknowledged, such as inequalities related to class, institutions and corporations, gender and sexuality, as well as race. This is not only related to the politics of representation but also how power differentials are implicit in code that is not neural, in terms of binary logic, hirerarchies, naming of attributes, accessibility and how wider societal inequalities are further reinforced and perpetuated through nonrepresentational computation. The handbook introduces and demonstrates a distinctive approach through the intersectional and reflexive practice of aesthetic programming, engaging with programming as a way to question existing technological interfaces and further create changes in the technical system.
