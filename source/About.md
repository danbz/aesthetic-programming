**Winnie Soon** was born and raised in the Western/Eastern (post)colonial city of Hong Kong. As an artist-coder-researcher, she/they is interested in queering the intersections of technical and artistic practices as a feminist praxis, with works appearing in museums/galleries, festivals, distributed networks, papers and books. Researching in the areas of software studies and computational arts, she/they is currently Assistant Professor at Aarhus University, Denmark.

**Geoff Cox** likes not to think of himself as an old white man from a parochial island but is clearly in denial. Other aspects of his identity are thankfully more ambiguous and fluid. Research interests lie broadly across contemporary aesthetics and software studies, reflected in his academic position as Associate Professor and co-Director of the Centre for the Study of the Networked Image at London South Bank University, and as visiting academic at Aarhus University.
