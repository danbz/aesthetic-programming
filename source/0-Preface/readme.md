### What kind of book is this?

As indicated by its subtitle, this book is meant to be a handbook of sorts, but not in any conventional sense of it being a prescribed set of technical instructions.[^instructions] Not meant to be read to simply learn to code or to offer critical reflection upon the practice of coding alone, instead it offers something more messy and at the same time more "useful" we would say: a book about the more complex and deeply entangled set of relations between writing, coding and thinking.[^useful]

Most programming books are written with the primary objective of teaching readers how to learn a programming language to become a good (or better) programmer, with an emphasis on state-of-the-art technology, as well as practical examples that are explained and then designed to be deployed in technology-related or creative industries. Not many programming books address the cultural and aesthetic dimensions of programming as a means to think and act critically.[^guzdial] Emerging trans-disciplinary fields involving computational technology — such as software studies, platform studies, and digital humanities to an extent — incorporate the practice of programming into the object of study, yet little practical detail is provided in terms of putting programming into a critical perspective, especially for those studying non-technical or non-scientific disciplines. This book attempts to address this gap between available literature and the growing interest in "computational thinking"[^ct] to expand programming beyond the confines of computer science (or even the digital humanities, which presents another set of limitations). We consider our approach to be distinctive from other books that focus more on programming from an engineering perspective, as well as distinctive from other theoretical books in which source code becomes an illustration of the programmer's thinking or a too-easy analogy for the hidden layers of operations (if not ignored altogether).

Whilst operating broadly in the spirit of Software Studies,[^Fuller] the book offers an applied and overtly practice-based approach to understanding the importance of programming — reading, writing and thinking with software — as a critical tool for our times, recognizing of the way in which our experiences are ever more programmed. It is offered as a deep learning "tool" in its widest sense — a handbook for those unaccustomed to programming — that allows for the programmer's conceptual skills to develop as they become technically more proficient.

To reiterate, our intention is for readers to acquire key programming skills in order to read, write and think with, and through code (and we will return to the issue of literacy later). We feel that it is important to further explore the intersections of technical and cultural aspects of code in order to reflect deeply on the pervasiveness of computational culture and its social and cultural effects — from the language and politics of human-machine languages to abstraction of objects, datafication and recent developments in automated machine intelligence, for example. In other words, the book embraces both the technical aspects and formal qualities of code as well as imaginaries of code, including acknowledgement of the material conditions of programming practice, the non-human agency of code itself, and its inherent relationality within broader ecologies.     

Alongside learning to program, we aim to bridge the gap between theories of computational culture, aesthetics and cultural studies. As part of this, we take a particular interest in power relations that are under-acknowledged, such as inequalities related to class and capitalism, gender and sexuality, as well as race and colonialism.[^decolonial] This is not only related to the politics of representation, but also to how power differentials are implicit in code that is never neutral, in terms of binary logic, hierarchies, naming of attributes, accessibility, and how wider societal inequalities are further reinforced and perpetuated through non-representational computation. In short, the handbook introduces and demonstrates a distinctive approach to the intersectional and reflexive practice of aesthetic programming as we understand it.

### So why aesthetic programming?

The argument the book follows is that computational culture is not just a trendy subject to study to improve problem-solving and analytical skills, or a way to understand more about what is happening with computational processes, but is a means to engage with programming to question existing technological paradigms and further create changes in the technical system. We therefore consider programming to be a dynamic cultural practice and phenomenon, a way of thinking and doing in the world, and a means of understanding some of the complex procedures that underwrite our lived realities, in order to act upon those realities.  

The phrase "aesthetic programming" best describes this approach in our opinion. We claim a certain distinctiveness in this, but of course aesthetic programming is close to other phrases such as "creative coding" and "exploratory programming" that have been introduced in related literature in recent years to emphasize the expressivity of computer programming beyond something pragmatic and functional, in which cultural production, or critical thinking using the practice of programming, can be developed from the broad perspective of the arts and humanities.[^Refs] It should be explained that the title "aesthetic programming" actually derives from one of the undergraduate courses of the Digital Design degree program at Aarhus University in Denmark, which has been taught in parallel to a course in Software Studies since 2013. Taken together, these courses offer ways of thinking with software to understand wider political and aesthetic phenomena. We follow the principle that the growing importance of software requires a new kind of cultural thinking, and curriculum, that can account for, and with which to understand better, from within, the politics and aesthetics of algorithmic procedures, data processing, and abstracted modeling. The book's structure largely emerges from the experience of teaching these courses and we thank all our students and fellow teachers for their valuable contributions and critical feedback along the way.[^people]

Continuing the discussion of aesthetics, it should be clear that we do not refer to ideas of beauty as it is commonly misunderstood (aka bourgeois aesthetics), but to political aesthetics: to what presents itself to sense-making experience and bodily perception (to paraphrase Jacques Rancière's *The Politics of Aesthetics*, as one key reference).[^Ranciere] How we perceive the world in this political sense is not fixed, but is in constant flux, much like software itself.

Political aesthetics also refers back to the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, particularly to the ideas of Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, that enforce the concept that cultural production — which would now naturally include programming — must be seen in a social context. Programming becomes a kind of "force-field" with which to understand material conditions and social contradictions, just as the interpretation of art once operated "as a kind of code language for processes taking place within society."[^Jay] The essay by Benjamin on technical reproducibility becomes a touchstone for collapsing some myths of artistic production including the dismantling of the aesthetic experience of "aura" (the mark of an artwork's authenticity and originality).[^Benjamin] It is worth remembering that Adorno and Benjamin famously disagreed on the consequences of this destruction of aura: whilst Benjamin expressed the positive aspects of this shift and viewed the destruction of aura as a kind of political emancipation, Adorno expressed the negative view that standardization and pseudo-individuality would follow. These tendencies have accelerated with computational culture, hence the continuing need for sharp critique, and one also based along the lines of "immanent criticism," that which is inherent, as it operates within its object, in the inner workings of software and its material conditions.[^Adorno] It remains in question as to what extent these old (white, male) references are up to the task of unpicking the complexity of computational operations, and address the ways in which most people use computers or think about them. This is as much to do with what aesthetic programming is becoming as to what it is or was, and why we take our point of departure from such references.

To address this upgrade of immanent critique we have been working with fundamental programming concepts, such as geometry and object abstraction; variables, data types, functions, and their naming, as well as data capturing, processing and automation, as the starting point for further aesthetic reflection whereby the technical functions set the groundwork for further understanding of how cultural phenomena are constructed and operationalized. Aesthetic programming in this sense is considered as a practice to build things, but also with the need to produce critique. This comes close to Philip Agre's notion of "critical technical practice" with its bringing together of different perspectives: formal technical logic and discursive cultural meaning.[^agre] In other words, this necessitates a practical understanding and knowledge of programming to underpin critical understanding of techno-cultural systems, grounded on levels of expertise in both fields — as in Wendy Hui Kyong Chun's case.[^Chun] We hope to encourage more and more people to defy the separation of fields in this way.    

### And software studies?

With this in mind, we draw heavily upon the field of Software Studies, and to an extent Critical Code Studies — the work of Wendy Chun, Matthew Fuller, Mark Marino and others, including our own earlier work — to deal with and communicate knowledge of software as a cultural form via analyses of examples of software artefacts and close readings of theoretical texts and source code. In terms of approach we take our inspiration largely from Fuller's *Software Studies: A Lexicon* from 2008, structured literally as a lexicon of key terms, it in turn taking its cue from the Raymond Williams's *Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society* first published in 1958.[^Williams] In many ways, and simply put, our book can be thought of adopting a similar approach of zooming in on the formal logics of computation and zooming out to the cultural implications of software. In this respect it is also important to recognize that the book *Software Studies* derived from a workshop, and it is worth quoting the project page for its clarity of intention:

> "[T]he project aims at folding the internalist/externalist question of science studies inside out, the mechanisms of the one conjugating the subject of the other: what does software-enabled scholarship, in software, art, and literary practice have to say about its own medium? The purpose of this interaction is therefore not to stage some revelation of a supposed hidden truth of software, to unmask its esoteric reality, but to see what it is and what it can be coupled with: a rich seam of paradoxical conjunctions in which the speed and rationality of computation meets with its ostensible outside."[^ss]

We believe that paying attention to fundamental, or key, concepts from programming provides the opportunity to open up new insights into aesthetics and critical theory, as well as new perspectives on cultural phenomena increasingly bound to computational logic. By extending the discussion beyond formal logic to its outside, we also emphasize the usefulness of artistic practice for opening up more speculative, alternative imaginaries. In this spirit, and in keeping with the development of software studies in Europe at least, we take inspiration from what has been referred to as software art (although admittedly the category was only meant as a placeholder) or computational art.[^Readme] That we draw upon examples from artistic (and critical design) practices as part of our argument, including paying close attention to works by one of us (Winnie Soon), stresses our point that programming is not simply a practical tool that produces an artwork, but is a critical-aesthetic object in its own right.[^codestudies] As media theorist Tilman Baumgärtel once neatly clarified:

> "Software art is not art that has been created with the help of a computer but art that happens in the computer. Software is not programmed by artists, in order to produce autonomous work, but the software itself is the artwork. What is crucial here is not the result but the process triggered in the computer by the program code."[^Cox]

We would argue something similar for writing this book. Moreover, in order to discuss the aesthetic dimensions of code and computational processes, we incorporate artistic works that explore the material conditions of software and the operations of computational processes as practical and theoretical examples. They are an integral part of our argument in other words, as well as usefully demonstrate some of the ideas in practice and offer unexpected epistemic insights. We might add, repeating what has already been introduced, that we are not simply interested in a critical aesthetics of programming but also programming as critical aesthetics.

### Open publishing

More to the point, text is in code (in the ways that it is made human-readable) and code is in text (in the use of the text editor, interfaces and online platforms we use to render these thoughts). There is more to say on this, and we will return to these issues across the various chapters of the book, each following the logic of fundamental programming concepts. Suffice to say for now, that the book sets out to express how writing and coding are entangled, and how neither should be privileged over the other: we learn from their relationality. Writing code and writing about code are forced together in ways that reflect broader cultural and technical shifts in data practices and open publishing initiatives, and, moreover, emphasize that writing a book is necessarily a work in progress. In other words, this is a book to be read and acted upon, shared and rewritten.

There are clearly many precedents for such an overtly collaborative approach to software production, and clearly, free and open source principles underscore our thinking. It is worth emphasizing that FOSS development is a collective practice that challenges the normative relations of production associated with commercial development, such as a narrow definition of authorship and copyright, which can be extended to the production of books and the associated reputation economy of academic publishing. However, we also recognize that the release of source code and open access books represents a number of ambiguities related to the sharing economy, free market capitalism, and opportunities to capitalize on free labor. We persist in the hope that our efforts challenge reductive logic, and our publisher, Open Humanities Press, broadly reflects FOSS principles of transparency and reproducibility in its commitment to open access for scholarly work.[^OHP] As such, this book can be downloaded for free or purchased as a hard copy at a reasonable price.

This is nothing particularly original. We acknowledge the numerous other experimental publishing initiatives and even "anti-platforms" such as dokieli for decentralized article publishing.[^dok] There are also plenty of other examples that have picked up on the perversity of writing books about programming where you have to type out the examples to run them, and live coding platforms demonstrate alternatives (e.g. Jupyter Notebook or DevDocs[^devdocs]). Our use of print and an associated software repository is our way of managing this problem. This also informed our choice of designers for the book: Open Source Publishing collective (OSP) design using only free and open source software — "pieces of software that invite their users to take part in their elaboration," as they put it[^OSP] — and make all files freely available using a Git versioning system that contains all the files for the project, distributed under the terms of Version 2 of the GNU General Public License. The following chapter introduces this.  

The use of a Git repository for our writing further emphasizes these FOSS working principles, and, by treating writing as software, or indeed software as writing, allows us to formalize the production of the book as an iterative process, in need of timely updates, allowing for forking and endless reversioning. By allowing new versions to be produced by others, we hope in a modest way to challenge commercial publishing conventions and illuminate our capacity to understand some of the infrastructures through which we encode our ideas and distribute them across networks. We believe that this way of working marks a departure point for collectively engaging with programming and creating changes in the social-technical systems (both inside and out). We aim to do something similar to what Adrian Mackenzie has identified as “auto-archaeology” to indicate how the object of study is fully integrated into the analysis, which he demonstrated using the associated GitHub site for his 2017 book *Machine Learners*.[^Mackenzie] This helps us as readers to understand something of the iterative process of writing a book about code in the spirit of how software developers collaborate, host, review, and merge code, as well as build software together. As a dynamic repository Git collapses the distinction between storage and production.[^Git]

### Flow of contents

Each chapter of the book starts with a flowchart[^flowchart] to provide a glimpse of the entangled relationships between the formal/technical and aesthetic/conceptual aspects of its contents. Each captures dynamic (learning) processes in both concrete and abstract representation for thinking with, especially the relations between the stage setup as expressed in the section "setup()," starting point as expressed in "start()," artefacts and sample code as expressed in "Source Code," formal and discursive activities concerning code and syntax as expressed in "Exercises and discussion in class," and further extended discussion as expressed in "While()." If a flow chart is conventionally used as an aid to the design of computational processes both for technical understanding and communication,[^diagram] then we also consider critical reflection to be an integral part of that process. Indeed, the flow chart serves as the starting point to exemplify our approach of turning concepts "inside out" and the need to understand computational and programmable objects, relations and processes in both logical and discursive forms.

Every chapter comes with an example that utilizes different technical syntax, facilitating the discussion of the formal aspects of code. But beyond that, we also have experienced that students, especially beginners, have difficulty in putting different functions together in a sketch. Although each chapter builds on the others, we have found that it is important to repeat the use of syntax and to show how different functions and syntax can be combined and used in multiple ways. Most individual functions can be found using the p5.js reference page or are available in other instructional online videos,[^shiffman] however we want to stress the importance of how to bring making and thinking together. Our examples were developed with this in mind and increase complexity progressively, and each sketch has less than one hundred lines of code for relative ease of comprehension. It should be said that we do not take effective and efficient code to be a priority here and will sometimes twist the expected use of syntax accordingly. Indeed we do not aim to offer a comprehensive list of the core p5 functions like many other programming books. Rather, we offer ways of explaining the syntax according to the examples that we have selected and for further discussion. Our examples, inspired by other artists, designers, scientists and theorists, were custom-made according to the perceived pace of learning and critical potential, with the incorporation of syntax and features that are closely aligned to the chapter's focus. The examples are provided to spark both the technical and conceptual discussion in and outside of the classroom. They are also closely related to the mini exercises (aka "miniX") that we have set out for each chapter with the dual elements[^dual] of RUNME and README to cultivate reflection by writing code and writing about code beyond the focus on solely functional and technical syntaxes, and students are free to explore, express and think creatively and conceptually by constructing critical artefacts. Using the pedagogic principle of "low floors, high ceilings,"[^papert] students can easily get started with the materials in the book like the RUNME and discussion, but each miniX also encourages independent learning and deep thinking by addressing the theme openly instead of looking for a set outcome. When it comes to practice and iterative learning, we have also included peer-feedback for every miniX so as to encourage learning through reading other people's code,[^readcode] and to further emphasize the diversity of approaches as well as the ability to share ideas in public.

This book was developed over the past five years through the actual setting of classroom assignments, in a very specific cultural and educational context, situated within an educational degree program in the humanities with a focus on software studies. Students mostly have no prior programming experience. The course runs for fourteen classes with blocks of eight and three contact hours every week — for Aesthetic Programming and Software Studies respectively. Though we offer ten main chapters here, in teaching practice[^teaching] provides a "pause week" to slow things down by not introducing new functions and syntaxes, instead revisiting previous ones and discussing what constitutes aesthetic programming, and how this links to their weekly practice and learning. We also have project weeks for preparation towards the final assessed submissions. Some flexibility is recommended if you are following this book for your own curriculum and clearly the intention is for readers to adapt, modify and re-arrange the contents to suit their purposes. Our contents are offered as a template of sorts and we understand that this might not be suitable in different contexts and we hope to open up different ways of learning to program, and, as such, we encourage our readers to fork a copy and customize their own versions for further modification. We view this as a sharable, adaptible recipe, and the analogy to cooking is something we would wish to encourage, as we attempted in the book with conceptual parallels: between variables and kitchen containers, algorithms and recipes, and so on. We take inspiration here from our book designers Open Source Publishing who have extensive experience of running workshops for beginners, and adopt their kitchen metaphors: drawing together practices of coding and cooking, tasting and testing, to invite further experimentation with various ingredients: "In the OSP kitchen, source files = ingredients."[^kitchen]  

### The book object

Finally we would like to stress that this book is not simply the physical object that you might be holding in your hands as you read these words, but a computational and networked object, distributed across various other spaces and temporalities, made available to both readers and writers alike. In saying this we refer to Benjamin again, and his essay "The Author as Producer" in which he writes: "The reader is always prepared to become a writer, in the sense of being one who describes or prescribes. [...] And writing about work makes up part of the skill necessary to perform it. Authority to write is no longer founded in a specialist training but in a polytechnical one, and so becomes common property."[^Benjamin2] Interestingly, for Benjamin, as with this book, cultural production requires a pedagogic function.

That is precisely our point. The book expresses itself as a dynamic object not fixed in terms of attribution or commodity form. It follows that, although this preface is only the beginning of the book, there can be no end: this book is purposefully stuck in an endless loop of its own becoming.

## Notes

[^instructions]: The casual address "for dummies" could also be used but this carries the unfortunate connotation of learning disability so we have dropped from our body text.

[^useful]: The book aims to provide some "useful knowledge." Here we refer to nonstandard literacy, such as in the article: Marilyn M. Cooper, "Really Useful Knowledge: A Cultural Studies Agenda for Writing Centers," *The Writing Center Journal* 14, no. 2 (Spring 1994): 97-111, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/43441948>.

[^ct]: Seymour Papert's influential book *Mindstorms* from 1980 introduced computing to children's learning. He coined the term "computuational thinking" to emphasize the practice of constructing procedures with the early programming language Logo (which does not simply use software as a tool), aiming to bridge the gap between mathematics, the culture of science and education as well as social critique. Donald Knuth made the concept of literacy more apparent in the book *Literate Programming* and considered a program literature which involves viewing programming languages as natural languages for human readers. In recent years the notion of computational thinking was also picked up by scholars in the field software studies, such as David Berry, Matthew Fuller, Nick Montfort and Annette Vee. See Seymour Papert, *Mindstorms; Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas* (New York: Basic Books, 1980); Donald Ervin Knuth, *Literate Programming* CSLI Lecture Notes, no. 27 (Stanford, CA: Center for the Study of Language and Information, 1992); Jeannette M. Wing, "Computational Thinking," *Commun. ACM* 49, no. 3 (March 2006): 33–35; Michael, Mateas, "Procedural Literacy: Educating the New Media Practitioner," *Horizon* 13, no. 2 (June 1, 2005): 101–11; David M.

[^Benjamin]: To quote Benjamin on this point: "The instant the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed.

(Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2002).

[^Adorno]: Adorno says it better: "A successful work of art, according to immanent criticism, is one that resolves objective contradictions in a spurious harmony, but one expresses the idea of harmony negatively by embodying the contradictions, pure and uncompromised, in its innermost structure" (Adorno, in *Prisms* (1967), 32; quoted in Jay, *Aesthetic Theory*, 179).

[^Readme]: We were highly influenced by the series of *Readme* festivals that promoted the artistic and experimental practice of software, which took place at the Marcros-Center in Moscow (2002), Media Centre Lume in Helsinki (2003), Aarhus University and Rum46 in Aarhus (2004), and HMKV in Dortmund (2005). The associated software art repository Runme.org was established in 2003, and many participants and people who submitted their works did not necessarily call themselves artists. Indeed the category of art in itself becomes inadequate to cover the kinds of creatives practices that have developed in the field.

[^codestudies]: The field Critical Code Studies (CCS) makes this explicit, promoting the examination of source code as a cultural object for critical analysis. As Mark Marino suggests that CCS pays attention to code as textual materials and its main argument is that code itself can be considered as a "cultural text worthy of analysis and rich with possibilities for interpretation", and furthermore, code allows one to reflect "on the relations between the code itself, the coding architecture, the functioning of code, and specific programming choices or expressions, to that which it acts upon, outputs, processes, and represents". See Mark C. Marino, “[Critical Code Studies](https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/critical-code-studies/)”, *Electronic Book Review* (December 4, 2006); "Field Report for Critical Code Studies," *Computational Culture* 4 (9th November 2014), <http://computationalculture.net/field-report-for-critical-code-studies-2014%e2%80%a8/>; Mark C.
