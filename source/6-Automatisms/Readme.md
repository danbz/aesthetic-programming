## Automatisms 

## setup() 

- sol lewitt's concept art + rule-based structure
- ideas as form 
- generative art 
- Turing machine 
- Focus on rules, orders, chaos, emergent behaviors 
- the recode project 
- Generators and other automatisms (genotypes), love letter generators

## start()

- 10 print

## Source code (Langton Ant)


## Exercise in class
Discussion:

- What have been generated beyond the end product but to focus on systems and processes? or How would you understand "autonomy is the ultimate goal" (Marius Watz 2007)?
- What is the role of rules and "software as material" (Marius Watz 2007), and do you consider the machine as a co-author?

## While()

## Mini_Exercise[6]: A generative program

**Objectives:**
- To implement a rule-based generative program from scratch.
- To strengthen the computational use of loops and conditional statements in a program.
- To reflect upon the concept of automatism conceptually and practically, such as systems, rules, temporality, emergence and processes.

**To get some additional inspiration here:**
- [Generative Design - sketches](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/), [soure code](https://github.com/generative-design/Code-Package-p5.js)
- [GenArt (with source code)](https://github.com/JosephFiola/GenArt) by JosephFiola, see ch.1-4
- [Open Processing with the search keyword 'generative'](https://www.openprocessing.org/browse/?q=generative&time=anytime&type=all#)
- [John Conway's Game of Life](http://web.stanford.edu/~cdebs/GameOfLife/)

**Tasks (RUNME):**
1. Start with a blank paper. Think of at least three simple rules that you want to implement in a generative program. (You may take reference from Langton's ant (1986) and The Game of Life (1970))
2. Based on the rules that you set in step 1, then design a generative program that utilizes at least one for-loop/while-loop and one conditional statement but without any direct interactivity. Just let the program runs and emerges automatically.(You may also consider to use noise() and random() syntax)

**Questions to think about as README:**
- What are the rules in your generative program and describe how your program performs over time. What have been generated beyond just the end product?
- What's the role of rules and processes in your work?
- What's generativity and automatism? How does this mini-exericse help you to understand what might be generativity and automatism?
