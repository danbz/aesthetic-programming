## Exercise in class

Draw a flow chart based on below code:

```javascript
function setup() {
  var sometext = ['h','e','l','l','o'];
  for (var i=0;i<sometext.length; i++) {
    console.log(sometext[i]);
  }
}

/*output
h
e
l
l
o
*/

```

A flow chart shows a breakdown of tasks representing procedures, step-by-step progression and algorithms. It is not a detailed flow chart that includes every possible computational steps but rather it demonstrates high-level processes for visual understanding that gives a general idea of how tasks are broken down. It is independent of any programming language as it concerns procedures but not coding syntax.

## Discussion
According to Ensmenger (2016):

1. how would you understand "To view the computer flowchart as having only one purpose is narrow and misleading" as he suggests that "every flowchart had multiple meanings and served several purposes simultaneously"?

2. How would you expand this line of thinking? "Flowcharts allow us to "see" software in ways that are otherwise impossible"

## Mini_Exercise[9]: 

**Objective:**

- To acquire the ability to decompose/break down a computer program into definable parts
- To organize and structure a computer program through a flow chart
- To understand flowchart as a means for communication and planning
- To understand the concept of algorithms from both computer science and cultural perspectives

**Tasks:**

Individual: 
* Revisit your previous mini exercises and select the most technically complex one
* Draw an individual flow chart to present the program (Pay attention to: which items you select to present through a flow chart)

Group:
* Brainstorm two ideas for the final project 
* Draw two flow charts to visualize the algorithmic process of the forthcoming final project's program

**Questions to think about as README:**
- What's the challenges to get the balance between simplicity at the level of communication and complexity at the level of algorithmic logics?
- What might be the possible technical challenges for the two ideas and how are you going to solve them?
- What's the role of the individual and the group flow chart that you have done?
