## 2.8 Mini_Exercise[4]: Capture All

**Objective:**
- To experiment various data capturing inputs, including audio, mouse, keyboard, web camera and beyond.
- To critically reflect upon the activity of data capture in digital culture (beyond buttons).

**To get some additional inspiration here:**
- [nonsense](http://siusoon.net/nonsense/) (2015) by Winnie Soon (look at the comment in the source code to get a sense of the work's concept)
- [Facebook Demetricator](https://bengrosser.com/projects/facebook-demetricator/) by Benjamin Grosser
- [LAUREN](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/LAUREN) by Lauren McCarthy
- [Feedback Machines](https://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/feedback-machines-mis-using-technology-non-linear-behavioural-systems/)

**Tasks (RUNME):**
1. Experiment various data capturing input and interactive devices, such as audio, mouse, keyboard, web camera, etc.
2. Develop a sketch that response loosely to the open call ["CAPTURE ALL"](https://transmediale.de/content/call-for-works-2015) from Transmediale 2015 that acts as the guideline for this mini exercise. (Imagine you are submitting a sketch/an artwork/a critical or speculative design work to Transmediale, hoping your sketch will be selected in the forthcoming exhibition. It is not a usual 'design brief' as you normally see with clear 'instructions' or 'problems to be solved' but it requires more conceptual thinking on problematizing the notion of 'capture all' and to think about what does it mean by 'data capture'.)

**Questions to think about as README:**
- **Describe** your program and what you have used and learnt
- **Articulate** how do your program and thoughts behind address the open call from Transmediale 2015. 
- What might be the cultural implicatons of data capture?
