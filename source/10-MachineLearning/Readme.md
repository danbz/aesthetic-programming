*Figure 10.1: The flow diagram of Eliza (1966) by Joseph Weizenbaum*

This chapter begins with a diagram that describes how a chatbot works procedurally. *Eliza*, a computer program but it also often describes  as a computer therapist, was considered as one of the first chatbot created in the mid-1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT. Involving natural language processing, *Eliza* implements keywords recognition in which it takes in textual input from a patient and output responses that simulate a doctor therapist by following certain language rules with psycological considerations. Such conversations involve an "illusion" [^Weizenbaum] in blurring the boundary between humans and machines. Evidently, *Eliza* exhibits some kinds of intelligence, with reference to the Turing Test[^Turing], not only it is able to maintain a relevant and personalized dialogue over time but also as Weizenbaum notes, "[s]ome subjects have been very hard to convince that ELIZA is not human."[^Weizenbaum2]  

This kind of artificial intelligence deals with expectation, and in computer science terms it is called prediction. What do you expect when you are interacting with a device/screen interface that is based on the experience, in terms of human interactions, that you have in the past? Latest technology of voice assistants in particular demonstrates the smoothness of conversations, such as asking the assistant to switch on/off a light, to play a certain style of music, to reserve a table at a restaurant and to seek help from customer services, these assistants are able to *learn the style* of human behaviors mostly based on data sets that are trained and through machine learning models to recognize patterns.  

However, pattern recognization is a political issue as argued by Clemens Apprich, and it is not a neutral process as it involves the identification of input data and the discrimination of information.[^clemens] It is not difficult to experience inherent ideologies in machine learning processes, such as gender stereotypes as found in the online translation tool[^online], the AI chatbot that was regarded as racist[^tay], racial bias as found in facial recognization regarding border control and criminal identification [^face], and many others. As such, machine learning or pattern recognition is not only about smoothening tasks and efficiency in terms of technical operation but also as what Hito Steyerl would describe as "political operation" as it creates "subjects and subjection, knowledge, authority" as well as classification and categorization.[^hito]

There are many aesthetic and cultural aspects around machine learning, such as labour practices, bias, data collection, creativity and authorship, transparency, that we could discuss but we definately need more space, or perhaps even another book to continue this thread of critical discussion and learning. In view of the last chapter of this book, we take the advice from John Berger who is an art critic and wrote the infamous book *Ways of Seeing* in 1972, which is to call for an attitude of skepticism, to "remain skeptical"[^john], about what and how we read, see and know, extending from visual culture to machine learning algorithms and software production in general. Gathering, arranging, producing, generalizing knowledge automatically via machine operations is further bounded together with "systems of power". Instead of following the common objective of achieving the so-called accurate prediction in using machine learning, perhaps we need to first unsettle the relations between seeing and knowing.[^cox] By knowing how/what machine senses and at what conditions, it may illuminate the entanglement of knowldege and power, human and nonhuman operations.

## Mini_Exercise[10]: Final Project

Aesthetic Programming introduces computer coding as an aesthetic, expressive, creative and critical endeavour beyond its functional application. It explores coding as a practice of reading, writing and building, as well as thinking with and in the world, and understanding the complex computational procedures that underwrite our experiences and realities in digital culture. To address these intersections we have been working with fundamental concepts of programming as the starting point for further aesthetic reflection — such as geometry and object abstraction; variable, data type, functions and namings as well as data capturing, processing and automation — thereby the technical functionings are setting the ground works for further understanding of how cultural phenomena is constructed and operationalized.

By drawing upon different theoretical and conceptual texts from Aesthetic Programming, your task (as a group) is required to conceptualize, design, implement and articulate a computational artifact. Your work should demonstrate the ability to integrate practical programming skills and theoretical/aesthetic understandings to articulate and develop critical computational artifacts, examining the aesthetic, cultural, social and political aspects of software.

To begin with, there are few tips may help you to come up with a project idea:

1. You may take a look again on the themes that we have used and structured for inspiration, including literacy, variable geometry, infinite loops, data capture, object abstraction, auto generator, que(e)ry data, algorithmic procedures, machine learning and the relations to topics like writing and coding, faces, emojis, (micro)temporalities, capture all, interactivity, object orientation, rule-based systems, language, expressivity, electronic literature, algorithms, politics of data processing.

2. Take a look again on all the previous mini exercises and all the questions that were set. Is there any one that you want to explore further?

3. Is there any assigned/suggested text that you are especially connected with and you want to explore in a deeper way?

4. Is there any particular technical area that you want to explore and employ in this project such as games, data visualization, 2D/3D objects, and among others.

**RUNME:**
A piece of software written in p5.js (or a combination of HTML/CSS/JS/P5/node.js).

Remember to include all external libraries and data such as images, font, text file, sound etc. Furthermore, if you have borrowed other sample code or ideas, please cite your sources in the code comments.

**README:**
A single word document within 6-8 pages (max characters: 2400 per page include space) which has to be properly written academically with scholarly citations (exclude images, references and notes).

The document should include a title, a screen shot, a flow chart, references, a link to your final project's RUNME, the links to related projects (if there is any), as well as the links of all your previous mini exercises (as an appendix).

The README should address at least the following questions with the help of your source code, programming processes and your selected readings:

- What is your software about (short description: what is it, how does it work and what do you want to explore/unfold)?

- How does your work address at least one of the themes and further explore the intersections of technical and cultural aspects of code in order to reflect deeply on the pervasiveness of computational culture and its social and cultural effects?

- Open question: How do you see the project as a critical work in itself with some of the understanding of the inner workings of software and its material conditions?
