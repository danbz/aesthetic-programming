## Notes

[^title]: The title of this bonus chapter makes reference to *Recurrent Queer Imaginaries* by Helen Pritchard and Winnie Soon (2019), and that was exhibited in the Exhibiton Research Lab, Liverpool John Moores Universityâ€™s School of Art and Design, https://www.exhibition-research-lab.co.uk/exhibitions/recurrent-queer-imaginaries/. We are interested in how this book might offer imaginaries for asethetic programming, in terms of further iterations of and additions to chapters from others, and quote Ursula K. Le Guin:
"As you read a book word by word and page by page, you participate in its creation, just as a cellist playing a Bach suite participates, note by note, in the creation, the coming-to-be, the existence, of the music. And, as you read and re-read, the book of course participates in the creation of you, your thoughts and feelings, [...]the ongoing work, the present act of creation, is a collaboration by the words that stand on the page and the eyes that read them." - "Books Remembered" (article) Calendar, v.XXXVI, n.2, November 1977-June 1978, np. [G: how to cite this here?]
