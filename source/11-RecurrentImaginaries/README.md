## Notes

[^title]: The title of this bonus chapter references the work *Recurrent Queer Imaginaries* by Helen Pritchard and Winnie Soon. In particular, we are interested in how this book might open up different forms of imaginaries, in terms of reappropriating/adding chapters from the communities. We end with this quote from Ursula K. Le Guin who wrote the science fiction novel *The Left Hand of Darkness* in 1969: "The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty; not knowing what comes next."
