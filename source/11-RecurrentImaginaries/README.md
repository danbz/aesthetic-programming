## Notes

[^title]: The title of this bonus chapter references the work *Recurrent Queer Imaginaries* by Helen Pritchard and Winnie Soon. In particular, we are interested in how this book might open up different forms of imaginaries, in terms of reappropriating/adding chapters from the wider communities. We end with this quote from Ursula K. Le Guin: "As you read a book word by word and page by page, you participate in its creation, just as a cellist playing a Bach suite participates, note by note, in the creation, the coming-to-be, the existence, of the music. And, as you read and re-read, the book of course participates in the creation of you, your thoughts and feelings, the size and temper of your soul."
