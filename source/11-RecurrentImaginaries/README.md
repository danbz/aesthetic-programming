## Notes

[^title]: The title of this bonus chapter makes reference to *Recurrent Queer Imaginaries* by Helen Pritchard and Winnie Soon (2019), http://siusoon.net/recurrent-queer-imaginaries/ 
We are interested in how this book might offer imaginaries for asethetic programming, in terms of further iterations of and additions to chapters from others, and quote Ursula K. Le Guin: 
"As you read a book word by word and page by page, you participate in its creation, just as a cellist playing a Bach suite participates, note by note, in the creation, the coming-to-be, the existence, of the music. And, as you read and re-read, the book of course participates in the creation of you, your thoughts and feelings, the size and temper of your soul." ADD REF
