## Recurrent Imaginaries[^title]


## Notes

[^title]: The title of this bonus chapter references the work *Recurrent Queer Imaginaries* by Helen Pritchard and Winnie Soon. In particular, we are interested in how this book might open up different forms of imaginaries. We end with this quote from Ursula K. Le Guin with her science fiction novel *The Left Hand of Darkness" in 1969: "The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty; not knowing what comes next."
