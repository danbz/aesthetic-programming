**Description**
In science fiction the idea about who is in control when it comes to technology is widely examined through robots and AI technology dominating society in dystopian futures ,materialising the fear of technology becoming conscious and taking over. Although this is indeed a very scary thought, it is however not where the real issue of control within technology lies. The real issue of control is much less apparent and lies in the handling of our personal information and the underlying mechanisms happening without our knowledge which controls the distribution of our data, our behaviour, and our actions. This hidden element of control in software is what our work expands on.

Most notably, the unbalanced power structure and one-way direction of control is seen in some corporations handling of user’s behaviour online. It’s becoming commonly known that these corporations utilise excess data to provide personalised ads. And for some, this might not be that big of a problem, because why does it hurt to be presented with more relevant ads and news? What they don’t understand is that it goes deeper than just personalised and relevant ads. Most of the data is utilised to train models of human behaviour: How people with certain characteristics behave over time, and thus be able to predict what we will do, not only soon, but also later. This gives the corporations the chance to exert control over its users by shaping their behaviours and opinions. Cambridge Analytica is the most relevant example thereof. What is scary about this form of control is that it happens in the shadows, hidden and without our knowledge. Our work pulls these operations out of the dark and into the light for everyone to experience how the feeling of being in control and power is a mere illusion.

This artwork is an interactive program that finds its aesthetics from the Windows 98 desktopwhere 3 windows are open: A game, Instagram, and the Notepad. The participant is met by the game where the goal is to locate one of the 2 red cards out of 4 cards that face-down. If thep articipant locates a red card, they win that round and move on to the next. If not, they lose. The first screen in the game is a set of instructions for the participant to follow, where it is stated that the chance for a round win is 50/50. In the first round they will always succeed, however in the second round, 2 of the cards won’t be interactable resulting in the participant only being able to choose one of the black cards and ultimately losing the game. When the game is lost,something (or someone) takes over the control of the desktop, as posts, followers, and followings start to disappear from the Instagram window, the cursor moves without interaction from the participant, and messages appear in the Notepad as if something (or someone) is writing them out.
