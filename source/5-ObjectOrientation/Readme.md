Title: 5. Object Abstraction
page_order: 5

## Object Abstraction

## 5.1 setup()

Pause week before -> OOP 
abstraction is all over in computing, but we just choose to use this chapter to examplify it 
games 
food , steps 
politics -> representation

## Abstraction and OOP 

## The concept of object

## Source Code 

## class

## objects

## properties

## arguments

## behaviors

## Exercise in class

1. Tinkering - add features and behaviors 

2. Discussion in Groups:

- Try to discuss a game that you are familiar with and describe the characters/objects by using the concept and vocabulary of class and object. Can you identify the classes and objects within the chosen game?
- What powers computational objects have? (Fuller and Goffey 2017)
- What does it mean by object orientation as a sociotechnical practice? (Fuller and Goffery 2017)

## While()

## Mini_Exercise[5]: Games with objects

**Objective:**
- To implement a class-based object oriented sketch via abstracting and designing objects' properties and behaviors.
- To reflect upon object abstraction in the domain of digital culture

**Tasks (RUNME)**
1. Think of a simple game that you want to design and implement, what are the objects required? What are their properties and behaviors? At the most basic level, you need to **use class-based object oriented approach** to design your game components that can exhibit certain behaviors (that means you need to at least have a class, constructor and method). If you can master objects and classes, you may further work on a mini game (with basic rules) and/or with p5.play that works with data input and interactive devices (such as keyboard and mouse) that you have learned from previous classes.

**Questions to think about as README:**
- **Describe** how does your game/game objects work?
- **Describe** how you program the objects and their related attributes and methods in your game.
- **What** are the characteristics of object-oriented programming and implications of abstraction? 
- **Extend/connect** your game project to wider digital culture context, can you think of a digital example and describe how complex details and operations are being **abstracted**?
