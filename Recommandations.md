- Add language indications to the code blocks.
- Use markdown syntax for the images
- Use real markdown headers (normalize headers and subheaders)
- Keep saving the images and resources within the chapter folder

- We added title and page_order metadata for pelican.

# Visual language

Some inspirations:

## Issues (by Winnie)
- OSP: some markdowns are not working (leaving the [^xxx] in the text and not able to turn into citation no)
- OSP: some images need to resize but existing markdown syntax cannot support That
- OSP: need to think about how to present the duplicate code (markdown)
- OSP: need to think about how to present the executed / source code (markdown/interface - web+print)
- OSP: book cover - script to generate? (or using Langton's ant one)

**Questions**
- include students' work?
- how about list of artworks/projects and list of figures?
- TOC

**Outstanding from me:**
- Revisit Aesterik Painting ch. 3
x - Revisit ch.9 -> add the intext ref + the emoji EiC + new for loop structure
x - getting started -> add web IDE for gitlab + remove short cuts as each OS is slightly different
x - update ML - TM image -> screenshot
x - adjust flowcharts, more on arrows and relations
X - add reference + bibliography + projects.md
- ML chapter: update the auto chapter generator both models + screenshots when we have a finalized text

## Issues (by Geoff)
- copyedit text for flow and accessibility of language. Sternberg style guide?
- adjust references. Sternberg style guide?
- decide on US or UK spelling? make consistent throughout
- add further reading and/or bibliography, ideally both
- indexing? (ask OSP for automated version + code)
- peer review
- Check out
    - setup() - https://gitlab.com/siusoon/Aesthetic_Programming_Book/-/tree/master/source/5-AutoGenerator - DONE
    - except setup() - https://gitlab.com/siusoon/Aesthetic_Programming_Book/-/tree/master/source/8-Que(e)ryData - NOT sure what I am looking at, but all the same added Big Dick Data reference. -> everything la..as i have changed quite a lot..i guess is whether it can be understand the process from an ordinary person
    - Exercise in class - https://gitlab.com/siusoon/Aesthetic_Programming_Book/-/tree/master/source/9-AlgorithmicProcedures DONE
    - there is a line on adding literate programming in ch.7: https://gitlab.com/siusoon/Aesthetic_Programming_Book/-/tree/master/source/7-VocableCode
