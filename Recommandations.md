## Issues (by Winnie)
- OSP: some markdowns are not working (leaving the [^xxx] in the text and not able to turn into citation no)
- OSP: some images need to resize but existing markdown syntax cannot support That
- OSP: need to think about how to present the duplicate code (markdown)
- OSP: need to think about how to present the executed / source code (markdown/interface - web+print)
- OSP: book cover - script to generate? (or using Langton's ant one)

**Outstanding from me:**
- [x] Revisit ch.9 -> add the intext ref + the emoji EiC + new for loop structure
- [x] getting started -> add web IDE for gitlab + remove short cuts as each OS is slightly different
- [x] update ML - TM image -> screenshot
- [x] adjust flowcharts, more on arrows and relations
- [x] add ch reference + bibliography/projects.md
- - Revisit Aesterik Painting ch. 3
- ML chapter: update the auto chapter generator both models + screenshots when we have a finalized text
- include students' work? (put it up online only)
- TOC - flowchart

## Issues (by Geoff)
- [x] copyedit text for flow and accessibility of language. Sternberg style guide?
- [x] adjust references. Sternberg style guide?
- [x] decide on US or UK spelling? make consistent throughout -> US
- [x] add further reading and/or bibliography, ideally both
- OSP: indexing? (ask OSP for automated version + code)
- peer review (lauren+matthew)
- Check out

    - except setup() - https://gitlab.com/siusoon/Aesthetic_Programming_Book/-/tree/master/source/8-Que(e)ryData - NOT sure what I am looking at, but all the same added Big Dick Data reference. -> everything la..as i have changed quite a lot..i guess is whether it can be understand the process from an ordinary person
    - there is a line on adding literate programming in ch.7: https://gitlab.com/siusoon/Aesthetic_Programming_Book/-/tree/master/source/7-VocableCode
    - infinite loops > check references and add additional ^Bergson: ADD EXAMPLE. and ^End: ADD NOTE ^Heidegger: ADD NOTE.
