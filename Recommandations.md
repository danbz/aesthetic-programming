- Add language indications to the code blocks.
- Use markdown syntax for the images
- Use real markdown headers (normalize headers and subheaders)
- Keep saving the images and resources within the chapter folder

- We added title and page_order metadata for pelican.

# Visual language

Some inspirations:
- <https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html>
- <https://macintoshnotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/meldscreenshot2.jpg>

## OSP related
- OSP: some markdowns are not working (leaving the [^xxx] in the text and not able to turn into citation no)
- OSP: some images need to resize but existing markdown syntax cannot support That
- OSP: need to think about how to present the duplicate code (markdown)
- OSP: need to think about how to present the executed / source code (markdown/interface - web+print)
- OSP: book cover - script to generate? (or using Langton's ant one)
- OSP: added showcase.md (only available for online book), also bibliography, projects, reference(further reading) etc. 
- OSP: indexing? (ask OSP for automated version + code)
