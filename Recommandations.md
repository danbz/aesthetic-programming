- Add language indications to the code blocks.
- Use markdown syntax for the images
- Use real markdown headers (normalize headers and subheaders)
- Keep saving the images and resources within the chapter folder

- We added title and page_order metadata for pelican.

# Visual language

Some inspirations:

## Issues (by Winnie)
- some markdowns are not working (leaving the [^xxx] in the text and not able to turn into citation no)
- some images need to resize but existing markdown syntax cannot support That
- need to think about how to present the duplicate code (markdown)
- need to think about how to present the executed / source code (markdown/interface - web+print)
- book cover - script to generate? (or using Langton's ant one)

**Outstanding from me:**
- Revisit Aesterik Painting ch. 3
- Revisit ch.9 -> add the intext ref + the emoji EiC + new for loop structure
- getting started -> add web IDE for gitlab + remove short cuts as each OS is slightly different
- update ML - TM image -> screenshot
- update the auto chapter generator both models + screenshots when we have a more finalized text

## Issues (by Geoff)
- copyedit text for flow and accessibility of language
- adjust references
- decide on US or UK spelling? make consistent throughout
- add further reading and/or bibliography, ideally both
- indexing? (ask osp)
- peer review
